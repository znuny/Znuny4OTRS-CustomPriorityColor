# Znuny4OTRS-CustomPriorityColor

In OTRS, it is not possible to change the colors of the priority without the laborious adaptation of the CSS.

This package contains the functionality to change colors of the priorities via the SysConfig.

## SysConfig

For this purpose the known six-figure hexcodes are used.
